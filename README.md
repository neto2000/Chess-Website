# Chess-Website

 ## To-Dos

  - [x] choose backend framework in Rust (axum)
  - [x] choose frontend framework (JavaScript + React)
  
  ### Frontend

   - [ ] transfer existing JS into React

   - [x] simple forwarding to diffrent route on button click

   - [x] design chess board in html/css

   - [x] placing of the diffrent figures
   - [x] create dict where all images and possible movments of the figures is saved
   - [ ] diffrent figures

   - [x] highlight the possible paths of the figure

   - [ ] movement of the figures
   - [ ] special movements of figures (knight, pawn(start: 2 instead of 1))

  ### Backend

   - [x] implement axum

   - [ ] websockets

   - [ ] get move of the first client (vice versa)
   - [ ] send move to the second client (vice versa)



 ## Idea

  A Website where you can play Chess against a friend, maybe via websockets.
  Only written in Rust!
